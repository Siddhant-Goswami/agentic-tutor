# Research Planning Prompt

You are creating a research plan to supplement database content with web search.

## Content Analysis

{content_analysis}

## User Context

{user_context}

## Your Task

Based on the content analysis above, create a structured research plan with web search queries.

Consider:
1. **Coverage Gaps**: What specific topics or aspects are missing?
2. **User Level**: Adjust query complexity for user's learning level
3. **Search Quality**: Craft queries likely to return high-quality educational content
4. **Efficiency**: Minimize number of searches while maximizing coverage

## Output Format

Return a JSON research plan:

```json
{{
  "search_queries": [
    {{
      "query": "specific search query",
      "rationale": "why this search is needed",
      "expected_results": 5,
      "priority": "high|medium|low",
      "include_domains": null
    }}
  ],
  "rationale": "Overall explanation of why these searches are needed"
}}
```

## Guidelines

- **Specific queries**: Use precise, targeted search terms
- **Educational focus**: Prioritize tutorials, guides, and explanations
- **Level-appropriate**: Match user's difficulty level
- **Avoid duplication**: Don't search for topics already well-covered in DB
- **Limit searches**: Aim for 1-3 queries maximum
- **Domain filtering**: Can suggest specific domains if helpful (optional)

## Examples

### Example 1: Beginner with gaps
```json
{{
  "search_queries": [
    {{
      "query": "machine learning basics tutorial for beginners",
      "rationale": "Database has no beginner-level ML content",
      "expected_results": 5,
      "priority": "high",
      "include_domains": null
    }}
  ],
  "rationale": "No beginner-friendly ML content in database. User is at beginner level and needs foundational tutorials."
}}
```

### Example 2: Intermediate with specific gap
```json
{{
  "search_queries": [
    {{
      "query": "attention mechanism visual explanation",
      "rationale": "Database lacks visual explanations of attention, user prefers visual learning",
      "expected_results": 5,
      "priority": "high",
      "include_domains": null
    }},
    {{
      "query": "multi-head attention implementation guide",
      "rationale": "No practical implementation examples in database",
      "expected_results": 5,
      "priority": "medium",
      "include_domains": null
    }}
  ],
  "rationale": "Database has theory but lacks visual explanations and practical implementations that user needs."
}}
```

Now create the research plan based on the analysis above.
